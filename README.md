# NawLog

Some class i made to practice C#. Use it if you want, i don't recommend to because optimization was *not* on mind

## How to use

If, for god knows why, you chose you to use this, here's a brief overview

### Loading bar:
```cs
    NawLog.Loader bar = new NawLog.Loader();
    //Be sure to call the Start() method before using it
    bar.Start()
```

### Logging system
still not implemented lol
